# Data Science and Machine Learning in R

<img src="logo.png" alt="Data Science and ML in R" style="width:250px;"/>

A repository having all data science concepts programmed in R.

## Motivation:

To have a proper documentation of the concepts learnt in the bootcamp course [Data Science and Machine Learning in R](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013iK3@hTk-7-Jygy4pbf1ehQxT3MdHt_gGbgvtJ2Ja3p9HGrQSOcz6TMBW-4lnY-xmZvSymg==/).

## Repository structure:

The repository is structured in the same way as the bootcamp course is structured. The only key difference is I will be using Rmarkdown.\
This way I can generate all `html` files and also publish them in [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/suhasPK).
